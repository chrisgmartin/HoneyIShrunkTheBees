## Running of the Bees {.smaller}


- Bees: we love 'em, yet we don't help 'em
    - The most **effective** polinators on the planet
    - Our history dates back over 8,000 years ago
    
- Honey helps our economy and our health
    - Used in desserts, breads, barbecues, mustards, jellies and ointment treatments
    - Loaded with antibacterial and antifungal properties
    - Can treat dandruff, is used in energy drinks, and can treat wounds and burns
    - Can also help fight local allergies

## Conclusion: Plight of the Bumblebee {.smaller}

I fear that we are no closer to answering the question posed at the start: Do we rely on the bees? It is perhaps due to my selection of explantory variables, or heavy skewing of the data by using averages and 0's for missing values, or it could be simply that we were dealing with a time series (square peg in a round hole). Regardless, the analysis was very successful in uncovering some interesting information in the decline of honey production per colony since 1987. Our fears may be different than what I had expected. Rather than focusing our attention on the number of bees (which we can inconclusively say we should continue to worry about), **we should focus our attention on a possible exponential decline in honey.**

## Next Steps {.smaller}

There are several directions we could go from here. One direction could be analysing the number of bees in a colony and see how they influence the amount of honey a colony can produce: is there a point of marginal returns whereby adding bees to a colony actually hinders the production of honey? How good are the bees at pollinating and how efficient are they? In the end, my goal is to save the bees and help man-kind learn to live alongside them (and nature in general).

Another analysis would be to see the reverse of what I've done here: rather than see how these variables explain the honey production of a colony, see how honey production influences the other variables. This would give us much more insight into the over-arching question I posed at the outset: Do we rely on the bees?
