## The Long and Lonely Road

- Bees are our friends: we love 'em yet we don't help 'em
    - The most **effective** polinators on the planet
    - Our history dates back over 8,000 years ago
    
- Honey helps our economy and our health
    - Used in desserts, breads, barbecues, mustards, jellies and ointment treatments
    - Loaded with antibacterial and antifungal properties
    - Can treat dandruff, is used in energy drinks, and can treat wounds and burns
    - Can also help fight local allergies
